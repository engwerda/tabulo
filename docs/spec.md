# Tabulo specification

Tabulo is a planning companion for [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org). It gives a team a personal
dashboard, a kanban board, and an epics view on top of Forgejo issues and pull requests.
Forgejo stays the single source of truth: Tabulo stores only what Forgejo cannot.

## Users

- **Developers** want one page that lists their assignments, review requests, mentions, and
  unread notifications across every repository they can access.
- **Leads and product owners** want a board across repositories and a view of epic progress.
- **Forgejo administrators** want a tool that needs no Forgejo plugins, no admin rights, and no
  shared service account.

## Principles

1. **Forgejo is the source of truth.** Board columns, epics, and assignments are Forgejo labels,
   issue references, and issue fields. Removing Tabulo loses only card order and saved views.
2. **Act as the signed-in user.** Every Forgejo API call uses that user's OAuth token. Forgejo
   permissions apply unchanged, and the issue history attributes each change to the person who
   made it.
3. **Instance specifics are configuration.** The Forgejo URL, column labels, and epic marker are
   settings. The code contains no organization names.

## Views

| View | Milestone | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| My dashboard | 1 | Review requests, open issues and pull requests assigned to me, mentions, items I created, and unread notifications. |
| Board | 2 | Columns from exclusive scoped labels across chosen repositories. A drag changes the issue's status label or closes or reopens it. |
| Epics | 3 | Each epic with its child issues and progress. |

## Data rules

- **Columns.** An open issue belongs to the column of its exclusive status label. The default
  scope is `Status/`, so `Status/In Progress` maps to the "In Progress" column. An open issue
  without a status label is in "Todo". An issue closed within the last 14 days is in "Done".
- **Epics.** An epic is an issue with the configured epic label (default `Type/Epic`). Its
  children are the issues its body references in task-list lines (`- [ ] #12`, `repo#12`, or an
  issue URL). Forgejo dependencies are not epic links, because teams already use them for
  ordering.
- **Card order.** Forgejo has no rank field, so Tabulo stores the order of cards within a column.

## Architecture

- One Cloudflare Worker serves the API and the React single-page app.
- The server uses Hono for HTTP and Effect for the Forgejo client, storage, and errors.
  Forgejo responses are decoded with Effect Schema at the boundary.
- D1 (SQLite) stores sessions now, and card order and caches later. D1 is strongly consistent,
  so a refreshed token is never read stale. A Docker build with a SQLite file can replace D1
  later through the same storage service.
- The client uses React, TanStack Query, and Tailwind CSS.

### Sign-in

1. `GET /auth/login` stores a random `state` and a PKCE verifier, then redirects to Forgejo's
   authorize endpoint.
2. `GET /auth/callback` checks `state`, exchanges the code for access and refresh tokens, reads
   the Forgejo user, and creates a session.
3. The session cookie is random, `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Lax`. The database stores
   only its SHA-256 hash.
4. Tokens are encrypted with AES-GCM before they reach the database. They never reach the browser.
5. An expired access token is refreshed with the refresh token. The session ends only when
   Forgejo answers `invalid_grant`. Any other token endpoint failure returns HTTP 502 and keeps
   the session.
6. `POST /auth/logout` deletes the session. Requests that change state must carry an `Origin`
   header equal to `APP_URL`.

### Configuration

| Variable | Kind | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_URL` | var | Public URL of Tabulo. Builds the OAuth redirect URL `APP_URL/auth/callback`. |
| `FORGEJO_URL` | var | Base URL of the Forgejo instance. |
| `FORGEJO_CLIENT_ID` | var | OAuth2 application client ID. |
| `FORGEJO_CLIENT_SECRET` | secret | OAuth2 application client secret. |
| `SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | secret | 32 random bytes, base64. Encrypts stored tokens. |

## Milestones

1. **Sign-in and my dashboard.** Read-only. Deployable to Cloudflare.
2. **Board.** Columns, drag and drop with writes as the user, card order in D1, filters.
3. **Epics and live updates.** Epics view, Forgejo webhooks, Docker image.

## Non-goals

- Replacing Forgejo's issue pages. Tabulo links to them for reading and editing details.
- Supporting forges other than Forgejo and Gitea-compatible APIs.
- Storing issue content as a second source of truth.
